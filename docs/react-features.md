## React Features

[React Lazy:](reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) Load different parts of the application only when they're needed (code-splitting)

[Suspense:](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#route-based-code-splitting) Display useful loading states

[Context Api:](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level

[Hooks:](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) Let you use state and other React features without writing a class component. In other words, Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.
